# dotfiles

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~\Projects\dotfiles`.) The bootstrapper script will copy the files to your PowerShell Profile folder.

From PowerShell:
```posh
git clone https://github.com/mizuneko/dotfiles.git; cd dotfiles; . .\bootstrap.ps1
```

To update your settings, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository within PowerShell and then:

```posh
. .\setup_win.ps1
```

Note: You must have your execution policy set to unrestricted (or at least in bypass) for this to work: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.

### Git-free install

> **Note:** You must have your execution policy set to unrestricted (or at least in bypass) for this to work. To set this, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` from a PowerShell running as Administrator.

To install these dotfiles from PowerShell without Git:

```bash
iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.github.com/mizuneko/dotfiles/master/setup/install.ps1'))
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `.\extra.ps1` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don't want to commit to a public repository.

My `.\extra.ps1` looks something like this:

```posh
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
Set-Environment "GIT_AUTHOR_NAME" "Your Name","User"
Set-Environment "GIT_COMMITTER_NAME" $env:GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
git config --global user.name $env:GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
Set-Environment "GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" "youremail@example.com"
Set-Environment "GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" $env:GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
git config --global user.email $env:GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
```

Extras is designed to augment the existing settings and configuration. You could also use `./extra.ps1` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository, but it is probably better to [fork this repository](#forking-your-own-version).

## Forking your own version

If you do fork for your own custom configuration, you will need to touch a few files to reference your own repository, instead of mine.

Within `/setup/install.ps1`, modify the Repository variables.
```posh
$account = "mizuneko"
$repo    = "dotfiles"
$branch  = "master"
```

Finally, be sure to reference your own repository in the git-free installation command.
```bash
iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.github.com/$account/$repo/$branch/setup/install.ps1'))
```
